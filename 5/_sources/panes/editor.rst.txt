Editor

Spyder's multi-language **Editor** integrates a number of powerful tools right out of the box for an easy to use, efficient editing experience.
The Editor's key features include syntax highlighting (``pygments``); real-time code and style analysis (``pyflakes`` and ``pycodestyle``); on-demand completion, calltips and go-to-definition features (``rope`` and ``jedi``); a function/class browser, horizontal and vertical splitting, and much more.

===================
Defining code cells
===================

A "code cell" in Spyder is a block of lines, typically in a script, that can be easily executed all at once in the current :doc:`ipythonconsole`.
This is much like a "cell" in MATLAB (except without any need to enable a "cell mode", since in Spyder, cells are detected automatically).
You can divide your scripts into as many cells as needed, or none at allâ€”the choice is yours.

You can separate cells by lines starting with either:

* ``#%%`` (standard cell separator)
* ``# %%`` (standard cell separator, when file has been edited with Eclipse)
* ``# <codecell>`` (IPython notebook cell separator)

Providing a description to the right of the separator will give that cell its own name in the :guilabel:`Outline Explorer`.
